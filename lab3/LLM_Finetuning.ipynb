The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs.

By training the model further on a carefully curated dataset, we can modify its behavior, style, or capabilities. Fine-tuning is used in a variety of applications, not just language modeling. But in language modeling, fine-tuning can be used to:\n",

The forward pass gives us the logits -- which reflect the probability distribution over the next token -- for the next token. We can compute the loss by comparing the predicted logits to the true next token -- our target label. Note that this is effectively a classification problem! So, our loss can be captured by the cross entropy loss, and we can use PyTorch's [`nn.functional.cross_entropy`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy.html) function to compute it."

Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model.

A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior.
